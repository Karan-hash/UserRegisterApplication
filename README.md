# UserRegisterApplication
This is an application where user can register, login, logout and change there password. 
I have made apis for register, login , logout. and forget password. I have used mongodb atlas for creating my database. 
I have used views file to show frontend of application. My application can be run by first running npm install and then node server.js. 
I have also added sessions in my application during login. 
Image folder contains images of the frontend and database of application.
